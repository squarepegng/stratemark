 * Can this document support a URL-based router?
 *
 * HashRouter needs `window.location.href` to be a valid URL base — React Router
 * calls `new URL(...)` against it. Inside an `about:srcdoc` iframe (how some
 * viewers and note apps embed raw HTML) there is no real document URL, so that
 * throws `Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL` and the whole app falls into
 * its error boundary. Detect that case and fall back to an in-memory router:
 * deep links stop working, but the product renders and stays usable, which is
 * the right trade for an embed.
